"""
core/output.py
Assembles the final workbook by editing the DECRYPTED SOURCE WORKBOOK
in place, rather than building a brand-new workbook with hardcoded
styling.

REWRITTEN (this revision):
The previous version built a fresh openpyxl.Workbook() from scratch and
wrote every cell with a fixed, uniform style (navy header fill, thin grey
borders everywhere). That does NOT match the actual report's real
formatting, and it throws away whatever the source file's own
(hand-maintained) styling looked like.

What this file does instead — matching the manual process exactly:
- Start from the already-open `source_wb` (the decrypted original,
  loaded with formulas/styles intact via file_io.load_report_workbook).
- For each account that already has a row in a sheet, update ONLY the
  cell VALUES for columns that changed — its existing formatting
  (borders, fonts, fills, column widths) is left completely alone,
  because we never touch a cell's style when we're not touching its
  row for the first time.
- For a genuinely NEW row (new account added to DAILY/Trails, or a new
  PTP INVENTORY entry), the row's cell style is explicitly copied from
  the immediately preceding row before any value is written — this is
  the fix for the recurring "new rows have no border" bug that kept
  showing up when rows were appended without inheriting formatting.
- The ACTION CODE sheet is left completely untouched — it's a static
  reference sheet, never regenerated.
- Sheet order is preserved as it exists in the source workbook (do not
  reorder sheets — a prior version of this tool rebuilt sheet order from
  scratch, which is unnecessary and risks not matching the original).
